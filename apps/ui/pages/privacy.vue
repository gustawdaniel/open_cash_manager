          controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
          privacy practices of such other websites or third parties. We
          encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the
          privacy statements of each and every website that may collect Personal
          Information.

        <h2>Information security</h2>
        <p>
          We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
          secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or
          disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
          physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized
          access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in
          its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the
          Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we
          strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i)
          there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are
          beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any
          and all information and data exchanged between you and our Website
          cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be
          viewed or tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best
          efforts.

        <h2>Data breach</h2>
        <p>
          In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been
          compromised or usersâ€™ Personal Information has been disclosed to
          unrelated third-parties as a result of external activity, including,
          but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to
          take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to,
          investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and
          cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data
          breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals
          if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a
          result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When
          we do we will send you an email.
        </p>
        <h2>Legal disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if
          required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or
          similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
          disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or
          the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government
          request. In the event we go through a business transition, such as a
          merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion
          of its assets, your user account and personal data will likely be
          among the assets transferred.
