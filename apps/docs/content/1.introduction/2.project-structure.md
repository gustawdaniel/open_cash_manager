# Accounts

Account means - bucket that contains transactions. It is not account is sense of email + password that identify user, but rather "cash in selected currency" or "bank account in given bank".

Base for account model is `QifAccount` from package `gif-ts`.

```ts
type QifAccountType = 'Cash' | 'Bank' | 'CCard';

type QifAccount = {
    name: string;
    type: QifAccountType;
    currency?: string; // by default USD
    description?: string; // eg account number
    order?: number; // will be used to sort accounts in ui
    hidden?: boolean; // allow to archive instead of delete data
};
```

but we extended it by `id` that is generated by package `uid` and changed a little `type` and `curency`:


```ts
export interface Account extends Omit<QifAccount, 'type' | 'currency'> {
  type: AccountType;
  currency: Currency;
  id: string;
}

```

there exists also computed account that is extended by `balance` computed from transactions assigned to it

``` ts
export interface ComputedAccount extends Account {
  balance: number;
}
```
