# Architecture

Project is developed in nx monorepo, but this is one application in `apps/ui` that do not need any server to work.

Server part will be created in the indefinite future to:

- provide currencies rates
- provide economic indicators (eg.: median salary)
- sync / backup encrypted data

The Existing frontend app is generally only visual layer to manage the following collections:

- accounts
- transactions belonging to accounts (transfers are pairs of transactions)
- categories / projects that can be assigned to transactions

It also helps to integrate these data with external files like csv/json uploaded to app - like transctions lists.
