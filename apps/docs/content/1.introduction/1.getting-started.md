# Architecture

Project is developed in nx monorepo but this is one application in `apps/ui` that do not need any server to work.

Server part will be created in indefinite future to:
- provide currencies rates
- provide economic indicators (eg.: median salary)
- sync / backup encrypted data

Existing frontend app is generally only visual layeor to manage the following collections:

- accounts
- transactions belonging to accounts (transfers are pairs of transactions)
- categories / projects - that can be assigned to transactions

It also help to integrate thsese data with external files like csv/json uploaded to app - like transctions lists.
